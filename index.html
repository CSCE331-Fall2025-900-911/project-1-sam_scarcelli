      <p class="description">
        I am a 20 year old undergraduate student at Texas A&M on a 4-year program for a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.
        I am from Fort Worth, Texas but, being a military brat, I have lived all over the world and have had to deal with constant change frequently.
        This has developed me into a resilient person who is capable of handling difficult situations and flexible to handle adversity.
        I take pride in upholding high standards, being accountable, adaptable, and in contributing to a meaningful effort.
        I work well in teams, not being fearful to take charge, but am also capable of completing projects individually.
        I would love to dive more into the world of programming and all of its capabilities.
