          For an entire semester, I went and gave back to my community by contributing to the noble effort of providing shelter, workspaces, and medical necessities to those who need it in Africa.
          The mission of this organization is to build necessary living expenditures out of storage containers for them to be transported to Africa.
          The process involves a group of young college students getting together with nothing more than the bare necessities of building an insulated interior to the storage containers and working from there until there is a livable space that can be filled with a multitude of different items depending on the usage of that container.
          The containers each would have different purposes, either being used for shelter in the means of a living quarters, being used as an office so that people could have a place to work or access the internet, or to be used as a medical area to treat sick people in small villages.

          My role as a commander in AFROTC is to lead, mentor, and develop freshman into impressive officers and successful leaders of character and merit. 
          I work hands on with a group of 10 freshmen as I help them navigate their life as a college student, a member of the Corps of Cadets, and as an Air Force cadet. 
          I meet with these freshmen multiple times a week to talk about their experiences, troubles and questions and assist them towards an easy and seamless freshmen year. 
          In addition to frequent meetings, I monitor the physical ability of each freshman during weekly workout that encompass many different techniques and disciplines necessary for a physically and mentally strong person. 
          The program is developed in this manner to help freshman grow through difficult times by allowing likeminded students who have experienced their hardships to help guide them towards a successful career in whatever trajectory their lives take them.
